The dataset includes a unique comment id, the text of the comment, and a series of binary labels applied by human raters: \"toxic,\" \"severe_toxic,\" \"obscene,\" \"threat,\" \"insult,\" and \"identity_hate.\" I have appended the \"score\" column, which represents the toxicity score assigned to the comment text by the live version of the Perspective API.

      " 一、动词ておく  \n",
      " 书上写的是“动词准备体由动词连用形后续“ておく”构成。”赋予ておく以动词准备体的语法成分。不过我不是很支持大家去背这些是什么体，什么体，日语里面这些体的数量足以让大家头晕了。书上这么写是出于语法研究的目的，以表现得正规。但是我们必须得明白，在考试的时候，不可能出填空题“问：某某某是_____体”的，和日本人交流，也不可能被他们问，这是什么语法成分。所以！我们只需要明白这几个假名表示的是什么意思即可。  \n",
      " 那么，我们就来看在使用动词ておく的时候，究竟可以表达出什么样的含义呢？  \n",
      " 1、为了准备某种目的而事先做好准备工作。  \n",
      " 来看个例句先：  \n",
      " e.g：昼ご飯といっしょに晩ご飯を作っていおいて、仕事に出かけました。  \n",
      " 做午饭的时候把晚饭也一起作了，然后才去上班。  \n",
      " 在这里我们可以明显的看到，作っていおいて表达出了处于可能是由于晚饭来不及作等原因，而事先做好了晚饭这个动作（作っていおいて是作っておく的接续形式，表示的是和后面出去上班的动作先后顺序）。  \n",
      "\n",
      " 2、表示让某种状态继续保持下来。  \n",
      " e.g：これは記念に残しておいてください。  \n",
      " 请把这个作为纪念（品）留下来吧。  \n",
      " 这里就表达出了把保留这个动作一直持续地作下去的意思。  \n",
      "\n",
      " 说老实话，这个用法对于非专业人士来说，要灵活的运用并不是件容易的事情。可能只有在日后更多的使用中来掌握了。  \n",
      "\n",
      " 二、动词てある  \n",
      " 书上赋役了这个用法“动词存续体”的语法含义。很不幸的，该用法在这课里面和前面的ておく一起出现，而且含义十分接近，这就直接导致了很多人弄混淆这两个用法。  \n",
      " 我们来看てある的用法吧。  \n",
      "\n",
      " 这也可以表示两种用法（-_-#）  \n",
      " 1、表示某事物保持某人动作的结果所造成的状态。  \n",
      " e.g：テーブルに食器が並べてあります。  \n",
      " 桌子上摆着餐具。  \n",
      " 表达桌子上一直保持这有餐具这个状态。  \n",
      "\n",
      " 2、表示事先做好了某事。（和ておく一比，该晕了吧？）  \n",
      " e.g：約束はしてありますか。  \n",
      " 事先约好了吧？  \n",
      "\n",
      " 在我学习这一课的时候，这两个语法也困扰了我很久，在很大的程度上也打击了我以后对日语学习的激情。第一册期末考试的时候，我还考了94分，全班第四，但是此后就每况愈下，沦落到70多了……唉。扯回正题，てある和てお\n",
